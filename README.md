# iced_dialog

Custom dialog for [`iced`](https://iced.rs)

It's mostly the dialog from @frgp42's [Fluent Iced Gallery](https://github.com/frgp42/fluent_iced_gallery), but made into a "widget"

## Example
See the [/example](/example) directory.

You can run it like this:
```bash
cargo run -p example
```
